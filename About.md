Hey! My name is Sean Thomas Wald, 
**I'm a Producer, 
** Multi-instrumentalist,
** and Singer/Songwriter!

---
I've been playing guitar from the age of 6, and ever since then I've had a passion both for playing music, but also writing it. I think as every writer's story goes: my initial songs were pretty objectively bad and very hard to listen to, but this didn't stop me from writing, so I kept making new songs, picking up new instruments along the way, and eventually got to where I am now!

Some of my biggest inspirations are 
*Gary Clark Jr. , 
*Royal Blood, 
*Highly Suspect, 
*Jimi Hendrix, 
*Reignwolf, 
*Trivium, 

and
*the Blue Stones. 

I love making blues rock although I never limit myself creatively, from making a metal album to making an (upcoming) electronic album
