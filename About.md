Hey! My name is Sean Thomas Wald, I'm a **Producer

---
I've been playing guitar from the age of 6, and ever since then I've had a passion both for playing music, but also writing it. I think as every writer's story goes: my initial songs were pretty objectively bad and very hard to listen to, but this didn't stop me from writing, so I kept making new songs, picking up new instruments along the way, and eventually got to where I am now!

just keep going

still going

trying to see how much i need before stuff happens
