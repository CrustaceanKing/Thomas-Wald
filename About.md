## About Me

I've been playing guitar from the age of 6, and ever since then I've had a passion both for playing music, but also writing it. I think as every writer's story goes: my initial songs were pretty objectively bad and very hard to listen to, but this didn't stop me from writing, so I kept making new songs, picking up new instruments along the way, and eventually got to where I am now!

Some of my Biggest inspirations are *Gary Clark Jr. , Royal Blood, Highly Suspect, Iration, Jimi Hendrix, Reignwolf, Trivium, and the Blue Stones*. I love making blues rock although I never limit myself creatively, from making a `Metal Album` to making an (upcoming) `electronica` album.

Also to clear up the air, the artist `Sean Wald` is where I release all instrumental songs/works I have done, and because of this it has a much quicker turn around time and is generally more fun to make. The artist `Thomas Wald` is where I release all my singles/songs featuring vocals and heavily promote my music. Due to the complexity of mixing and mastering vocals, these tracks take quite a bit of time, but in comparison to Sean Wald they always out-preform (My highest streaming song *Crossroads* , has nearly **10,000 Streams!** )

Here's a

to all my music, but for specific informtaion about each seperate artist, what goes behind making the music, each song, and a little about each song, read below;

## Recent Release - Tales Under the Twin Suns (Feburary- 2022)

This album took me about **5 years** to make, starting all the way back in **2017**. It started with an idea that I'd make a progressive metal album, but I had neither the skills nor the tools to complete this idea. 

*However*, 4 years later, after I had proved I could produce the music I had always envisioned in my head, *I returned to my former dreams*, and set my eyes on making this album. Through actual tears and sweat - which included (but not limited to) `getting my computer wet and therefore losing every single song I had ever made` - I was finally able to complete the album (with a little help from my friend/mentor/teemate/producer:

)

As much as I'd like to tell you all about how amazing this album is and what it sounds like, in my opinion it's impossible to try to describe music in words, so give it a

# Thomas Wald - Artist
As stated previously, the artist `Thomas Wald` is where I release all my **singles/songs** featuring **vocals** and **heavily promote my music**. 

For each single I make under `Thomas Wald` it generally takes anywhere from **a month** to up to **a year** just to fully *produce and release songs*, including promotional images and videos as well as getting everything in the track to meet streaming standards.

As stated, for Thomas Wald releases, I send them off to my producer
[Derek Cote](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1vCJJaoYrRpzzjlf5Ty568) (Varisonus)
so they can sound absolutely perfect. This added process takes copious amounts of time, but the end result is worth it, especially compared to the music released on `Sean Wald`

### Behind the Music
**Red**
> Recently, I've been getting a lot of what I can only characterize as Panic Attacks. My chest would start to hurt as if I had heart-burn on steriods, and it was hard to breathe. Always looking for new topics to write about, I decided to write about my experiences in facing these moments of panic (writing about trauma is something of a crux for me as you'll come to see). Lyrics such as "*the walls are closing in*", "*the nightmare won't end*", "*these voices in my head are telling me I should be dead*", all describe what I was feeling in the moment. I hoped in singing about this it'd not only give light to my experiences but also help those who were going through similar things, so maybe they could relate to what I was experiencing. Red was mixed & mastered by the afromentioned [Derek Cote](https://linktr.ee/varisonus), this song just recently hit **over 1,000 Streams!**

**Golden**
> For sake of anonymity, I'll try to keep the background as vague as possible, but around the time of this release, my ex broke up with me, and this was my way of coping: writing. It's about struggling to move on, but accepting it while still remembering the good memories, which in my life has been something I've had difficulty with.
> `Anyways`, *this song just hit* **over 2,000 Streams**, so obviously **Trauma is Profitable, Q.E.D.** (I hope I don't need to say this but this is a joke)
