Hey! My name is Sean Thomas Wald, 
I'm a Producer, 
Multi-instrumentalist,
and Singer/Songwriter!

I've been playing guitar from the age of 6, and ever since then I've had a passion both for playing music, but also writing it. I think as every writer's story goes: my initial songs were pretty objectively bad and very hard to listen to, but this didn't stop me from writing, so I kept making new songs, picking up new instruments along the way, and eventually got to where I am now!

Some of my biggest inspirations are Gary Clark Jr. , Royal Blood, Highly Suspect, Jimi Hendrix, Reignwolf, Trivium, and the Blue Stones. I love making blues rock although I never limit myself creatively, from making a metal album to making an (upcoming) electronic album

Also to clear up the air, the artist `Sean Wald` is where I release all instrumental songs/ works I have done, and because of this it is a lot easier to produce & more fun to make. The artist `Thomas Wald` is where I release all my singles/songs featuring vocals and heavily promote my music. Due to the complexity of mixing and mastering vocals, these tracks take quite a bit of time, but in comparison to Sean Wald they always out-preform (My highest streaming song *Crossroads* , has nearly **10,000 Streams!** )

This album took me about 5 years to make, starting all the way back in 2017. It started with an idea that I'd make a progressive metal album, but I had neither the skills nor the tools to complete this idea. 

However, 4 years later, after I had proved I could produce the music I had always envisioned in my head, I returned to my former dreams, and set my eyes on making this album. Through actual tears and sweat - which included getting my computer wet and therefore losing every single song I had ever made - I was finally able to complete the album (with a little help from my friend/mentor/teemate/producer:

The Music follows the journey of a man as he climbs Mount. Fuiji, while encountering several prespectives and themes about life once unconsidered

However, It'd be impossible to try to descrie music in words, so give it a
