## <span style="color:Grey">Introduction</span>
Hello! I am <span style="color:Grey">**Sean Thomas Orion Wald**</span>, <span style="color:Grey">**full time student at UCSD**</span>, currently pursuing a <span style="color:Grey">**BA in Mathematics - Computer Science Engineering**</span>. While I am a Sophomore in time only, I am a Junior in standing and am expected to graduate within June 2024 (normally, this would be around June 2025). 

When I'm not giving it 100% at school, I can be found <span style="color:White">*playing badminton*</span> for the UCSD Badminton Club, <span style="color:White">*recording music*</span> at my home studio, <span style="color:White">*playing venues*</span> live @UCSD, <span style="color:White">*swimming*</span> at the UCSD Rec Pool, <span style="color:White">*cycling & running*</span> around the La Jolla area (I'm training for a triathlon right now), <span style="color:White">*surfing*</span> on La Jolla cove, or in a Geisel library, either <span style="color:White">*coding pet projects of mine or reading*</span> a book. Additionally, I am <span style="color:White">*applying to become a volunteer*</span> at the Human Society in San Diego (check them out, you won't regret it)! You can find more information about all of these below, but I hope this gives you insight into the kind of person I am: **I am very energetic and creative, but I am also very disciplined to get the work I have done.**

If you are reading this, it is probable that you additionally *have a copy of my resume*, hence <span style="color:Grey">**I will avoid reciting what is presented on there, such as awards and accolades & relevant courses taken in High School & College**</span>, as not only would it be a waste of time but additionally <span style="color:Grey">**I do not believe boasting all my academic achievements would reflect well on me nor do I find bosting accurate to the who I am.**</span>

//future patch: place images here, 1 of cycling, surfing, etc.
